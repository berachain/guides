# Logo Generation Prompts

Five high-variation logo concepts for staking pool branding examples. Each should be 48x48px SVG format, suitable for use in a web application header.

## 1. Geometric Minimalist
**Prompt:** Create a minimalist geometric logo: a stylized shield or badge shape composed of interlocking triangles and hexagons, suggesting security and blockchain structure. Use a deep teal (#0d9488) background with white geometric elements. Clean lines, no gradients, suitable for dark theme interfaces.

## 2. Abstract Organic
**Prompt:** Design an abstract organic logo: flowing, interconnected circular forms that suggest network nodes or staking connections. Use a warm coral (#f87171) background with white flowing shapes that create a sense of movement and connectivity. Soft, rounded forms, modern and approachable.

## 3. Typographic Monogram

## 4. Iconic Symbol
**Prompt:** Design an iconic symbol logo: a stylized stack of coins or tokens with a checkmark or validation symbol integrated. Use a vibrant emerald (#059669) background with white iconography. The coins should be stacked in a way that suggests growth and accumulation, with a subtle validation mark. Clear, recognizable, trustworthy.

## 5. Abstract Tech
**Prompt:** Create an abstract tech logo: a circuit-like pattern or network diagram rendered as a stylized, simplified icon. Use a deep slate (#475569) background with bright cyan (#06b6d4) circuit lines. The pattern should suggest connectivity and technology without being too literal. Modern, technical, forward-looking.
