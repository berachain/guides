delegator-withdraw-principal.sh

Requests withdrawal of original delegated funds (delegator DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE only).
This is for capital providers to reclaim their principal after validator exit.

This generates FOUR commands:
1. Request principal withdrawal (includes withdrawal fee)
2. Complete withdrawal after cooldown period (~3 days / 129,600 blocks)
3. Undelegate funds after withdrawal completion
4. Withdraw BERA from handler to your address

Usage:
  delegator-withdraw-principal.sh --pubkey 0x... [--fee 0.001]
  
Required arguments:
  --pubkey 0x...            Validator pubkey (handler will be auto-detected from factory)
  
Optional arguments:
  --fee BERA                Withdrawal request fee (default: 0.001 BERA)

Output:
  delegator-withdraw-principal-1-request.sh
  delegator-withdraw-principal-2-complete.sh
  delegator-withdraw-principal-3-undelegate.sh
  delegator-withdraw-principal-4-withdraw.sh

Note: Principal withdrawals are independent of yield withdrawals.
The validator admin can withdraw yield at any time without affecting principal.
