# Bera-Thirdweb Example

This repo should serve as a code example of the guide mentioned in docs.

## Sum-up on the guide.

By the end of this guide, we will explore setting up thirdweb sdk's wallet connect kit and customize it to Berachain Artio Testnet.

As a bonus for the ones who read through the tutorial entirely - we’ve also added additional steps to show to capture wallet addresses of users trying to interact with your dApp. ❤️

## Quick Start - please do the following

1. yarn install
2. yarn dev
