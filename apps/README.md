# apps = production guides

Developer guides, tools, and production-ready examples for building on Berachain.

## Configuration

Many scripts and tools use shared configuration from `config.js` which provides:

- Network-specific RPC endpoints (mainnet/bepolia) with environment variable overrides
- Validator database integration
- Common helper functions for accessing chain configurations

The configuration file is shared from the parent repository's `exp/config.js`. If you're running scripts that reference `config.js`, you'll need to either:
- Copy `../exp/config.js` to `apps/config.js`, or
- Symlink it: `ln -s ../exp/config.js config.js`

## Directories
